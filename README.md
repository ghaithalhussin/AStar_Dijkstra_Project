# A* and Dijkstra Algorithms for Maze Solving

## Description
This project implements A* and Dijkstra algorithms to solve a shortest path problem in a procedurally generated 10x10 maze.

## Usage
1. Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```
   pip install numpy
   ```
3. Run the script:
   ```
   python astar_dijkstra.py
   ```

## Features
- Procedural maze generation with adjustable obstacle density.
- Performance comparison of A* and Dijkstra in terms of time complexity and explored nodes.

## Output
- Maze visualization as a matrix (0 = open, 1 = obstacle).
- Path, time, and explored nodes for each algorithm.
